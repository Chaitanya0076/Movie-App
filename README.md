# Movie-App

- You can directly start the application by adding the env variables and with the **npm run dev** command.
- Just a static **react** App with **Appwrite** used as backend to maintain the movie count that users have searched more frequently.
- I have used **typescript** as the language and vite as the bundler for my react app.
